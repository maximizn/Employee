#Employee
program created in Java. This program is used to create an Employee, entering first and last name. You then can see how much money your employee will make based on the type of contract they are on(commision, hourly, salary). You also can search an employees Id number. If you created one employee his ID # is 1, etc. Finally you can search for an Employee by last name.
